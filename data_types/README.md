# Python Data Types

## Built-in Data types
In programming, data type is an important concept.

Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.

Python has following data types built-in by default, in these categories:

| Category | Data type(s) |
| - | - |
| Text Type | `str` |
| Numeric Types | `int`, `float`, `complex` | 
| Sequence Types | `list`, `tuple`, `range` |
| Mapping Types | `dict` |
| Set Types | `set`, `frozenset` |
| Boolean Type | `bool` |
| Binary Types | `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview` |
| None Type | `NoneType` |
